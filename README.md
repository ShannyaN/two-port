## Installation
Extra equipment is not needed to view this project.

## Usage
This site provides a much more organized manner to present a developer's word to those looking to hire them for services or as an employee.

## Roadmap
I would add JavaScript to the site when learned to make it more interactive and possibly log inquiries.

## Project status
In progress.
